The original data in the sample mongoDB database includes stays in 15 different cities. Some of those have unusable names such as "Other (Domestic)" and three of them are in.... Hawaii! 

So after some filtering, the stay.json file contains 360 stays, 40 in each of the following cities:

* porto
* maui
* istanbul
* new-york
* barcelona
* sydney
* montreal
* rio-de-janeiro
* hong-kong


The original collections do not use ObjectId's for primary keys so those were generated by a script. I've left the original id's in the stay.json file along with the newly generated id's - for debug purposes.

Each stay was assigned 5 random images from the images found in the images folder.

All hosts and reviewers, 5482 in total, were placed into the user.json file.
As with the collection of stays, the original users don't have ObjectId's. So again - these were generated by a script and written along with the original id's into the user.json file.

I used the original id's as usernames and the fullname key for passwords like this:

	{
		"fullname": "Byul",
		"imgUrl": "https://robohash.org/92566174?set=set2",
		"username": "92566174",
		"password": "Byul",
		"id": "92566174",
		"_id": "61ec24922d177eff671e1346"
	},
