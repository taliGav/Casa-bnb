I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "

L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento.

Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. "

I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place.

The apartment is in building with a common courtyard (common for the style). The other people that live in the building were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had. My son was even able to play with the other children (despite the language barrier). Awesome experience -- would definietly rent again."

We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. "

            "about": "I am the owner of Maui Vision Rental. Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

Easy walk down to grass field and beach access right there.  Perfect for how many guest we had (5-6). Price was fair especially for the holiday week rates.  Left some extra body boards for future guests to enjoy.  Thank you Kathy for sharing your home.  Aloha "

The view was beautiful, the kitchen was fantastically equipped, the condo community went very quiet at night and the lovely sounds of the ocean waves rocked you to sleep each night. We were there in January and it was quite pleasant all day, but I think during the hotter months the front bedroom could get warmer. All bedrooms had windows that would open and most of time there was a strong breeze blowing through the entire condo. The general location, central Maui, was perfect as well. Just an excellent place to vacation."

We spent two months here and enjoyed every minute of it. "

The bathroom and the kitchen have a small window opening to the outside.  The windows in the Living room open into the stairwell.  Two bedrooms have a small balcony opening up into the alleyway.  Mariatchi Bar is downstairs.  Its great to get a drink just downstairs but it can get a bit noisy at night on the weekends.  (Because the buildings are so close together, any normal conversation seems loud as the sound bounces off the buildings)  Overall, Luis has an awesome place and I would definitely come back next year when I visit Barcelona."
